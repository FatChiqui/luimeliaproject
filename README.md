# luimeliaproject
This is my first website project. It is made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap basically for the frontend and for the backend I used NodeJs, Express.js and the template engine EJS. I just choose a topic and designed a little website using tools I've learned on the full stack course I made. 
So, to try and watch the website, you just need to initialize it running the index.js inside the src folder. Then you can open your browser and type localhost:3000. That will lead you to the homepage and finally you can navigate trought it. 

So, I will keep updating this project cause it stills being very plane and I pretend to add another functionalities, improve what I have and make it a more friendly page.

# luimeliaproject
This is my first website project. I just choose a topic and designed a little website using tools I've learned on the full stack course I made. 
So, to try and watch the website, you just need to initialize it running the index.js inside the src folder. Then you can open your browser and type localhost:3000. That will lead you to the homepage and finally you can navigate trought it.
